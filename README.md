# Sentiment-analysis-of-movie-reviews-using-machine-learning-algorithms
Sentiment Analysis is the process of understanding a personâ€™s opinion, expressed using text, to determine the attitude of the person towards the subject. In this project, we are performing sentiment analysis on IMDB movie review dataset. On observing the sentiment expression and extracting the features from the movie reviews, we are classifying the reviews into two classes - positive and negative. A comparative study of various learning algorithms is performed using 5 X 2-cross validation to find the most accurate model for this problem set. We have used two metrics - ROC AUC Score and F1 Score to evaluate the models. Out of all the learning algorithms performed in this project, Logistic Regression was found to have the best ROC AUC Score and F1 Score. We also come to the conclusion that ROC AUC Score and F1 Score correspond well with each other as we have balanced positive and negative reviews.
